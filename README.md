Learning how to create a new repository on Github (current steps):
1. After creating new project on IntelliJ, under VCS, select Share Project on Github to create a new repository on Github.
2. Once new repository is created, to commit any changes on Github using IntelliJ, first commit changes locally. 
3. After changes is committed, you have to push your changes to the repository using Git, select Push.
4. If you want to pull copy from the repository, select Pull instead.

Further comments and assistance to better make this process more efficient would be appreciated as I am still learning how to use Github.
